/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
The imported CSS rules must precede all other types of rules.

@example
  @import "~@nativescript/theme/css/core.css";
  @import "~@nativescript/theme/css/blue.css";

Jamie: I'll leave theming up to the consumer instead in RNS; it's too much
       of a black-box to me.
